# soapbot

A simple Discord Bot. You may notice in very early commits that an API key is visible, that is for the old Bot registration and doesn't do anything anymore.
Currently the key is hidden and read from an external location by the program. SOAP Bot grows in scope and size as I find time to work on it and learn
more about how to use Discord's API to build out new features.
