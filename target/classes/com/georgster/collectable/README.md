## Welcome to the SOAP Bot Trading Card System!

### Creating Your Cards

Have you ever wanted to create a card of your favorite character, like Pikachu? SOAP Bot allows you to unleash your creativity:

- **Design Your Card**: Craft your card with its unique attributes and artwork.
- **Set Initial Price**: Decide the initial price to buy the first version of your card from SOAP Bot.

### Buying and Selling Cards with SOAP Bot

SOAP Bot operates a fascinating economic model that's easy to understand yet offers depth for strategic players:

- **Purchasing Cards**: You can buy any card for its current price from SOAP Bot, but each subsequent purchase from SOAP Bot decreases the price by half.
- **Selling Cards**: Conversely, when you sell a card back to SOAP Bot, the scarcity increases, driving the card's cost upward.

### Engaging with Trade Offers
- **Trade Offers**: Beyond buying and selling, you have the power to exchange cards and coins with other users through Trade Offers.

### The Marketplace

The marketplace is where the community comes alive. Here you can:

- **List Your Cards**: Offer your cards for sale at a price you determine.
- **Buy From Others**: Browse the marketplace and purchase cards directly from other players.

*Note: Transactions in the marketplace do not affect the SOAP Bot's cost for a card.*

### Rarity and Cost

The thrill of collecting comes from the rarity of your cards, which is dynamically determined:

**Dynamic Rarity**: A card's rarity is indicated by its current cost, which fluctuates based on interactions with SOAP Bot.
- A **COMMON** card has a coin value of less than 1% of a Guild's total economy
- An **UNCOMMON** card has a coin value of at least 1% of the total economy.
- A **RARE** card has a coin value of at lest 5% of the total economy.
- A **LEGENDARY** card has a coin value of at least 10% of the total economy.
- a **UNIQUE** card has a coin value of at least 25% of the total economy.

### Smart Investments

Strategically buying and selling can lead to significant gains:

- **Profit from Fluctuations**: Buy a card at a lower price and sell it back at a higher cost as the market evolves.

### Inflating Card Values

Inflate the market and potentially your profits by investing your coins into a card's value:

- **Inflation**: Increase the cost of all versions of a card by putting your own coins into its value.
- **Division of Inflation**: The inflation is divided by the number of cards in rotation, increasing the cost equally for each card.

### An Example to Illustrate:

Imagine you have a Pikachu card when the cost is 10 coins, and there are two Pikachu cards in circulation. You decide to inflate the value by investing 200 coins.

- Your investment raises the cost of each Pikachu card by 100 coins (200 coins divided by 2 cards in rotation).
- The new cost of a Pikachu card would now be 110 coins.
- Selling back to SOAP Bot gives you 110 coins, and new buyers from SOAP Bot will have to pay 110 coins for the first Pikachu card after your inflation action.
